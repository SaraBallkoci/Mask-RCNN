## Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation on custom dataset

This is an implementation of Mask RCNN on our custom dataset which is the teeth of the excavator's sprocket.
The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.8.18

TensorFlow 2.4

## Installation:

Clone the repository:

-- git clone https://github.com/SaraBallkoci/Mask-RCNN.git

Install the required libraries:

-- pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the Mask R-CNN model and weights:

Download the mrcnn folder and weights file from Matterport's Mask R-CNN https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN repository and place them in the project directory. 

Unzip the dataset.zip, test_images.zip and mask_rcnn_object_0037.zip and put them in your project's directory.

## How to use

Run the custom implementation:
Open custom.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to perform tooth segmentation and train the model.

Test the model:
Open test_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to test and validate the model using the provided test images.
